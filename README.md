# AnalysisOfStringMatchingMethods

This was a project undertaken in my CMP 340 Design and Analysis of algorithms Course where my team mates and I implemented and performed
theoretical and experimental analysis on Brute Forse and Horspool String matching algoritms.

We used the SHERLOCK and WARANDPEACE books available on the Gutenberg Library.
